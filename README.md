# adTMO
This paper proposes an adversarial and adaptive tone mapping operator (**adTMO**) to convert high dynamic range images (HDR)  into low dynamic range (LDR) images. Our proposed **adTMO** is based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). We train our **adTMO** with 256 * 256 resolution images, and test its effectiveness on 256 * 256 and 1024 * 2048 resolution images.
